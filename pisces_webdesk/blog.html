                                    <p>Stagnant water is often the favourite destination of various diseases whereas flowing water which manages to find its way by cutting rocks often mesmerizes us with its scenic beauty. The philosophy of life too depends on this principle; stagnation rots you whereas moving makes us worthy of appreciation. </p>
                                    <p>A piece of machinery becomes obsolete if left unused, so are we. The moment we decide to stop, we are no more in use. In the era of technology where skill is like crude oil (ignoring the recent situation of crude oil), Updating yourself with new skills becomes very important. It hardly takes any time for a complacent person to become outdated. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Have you ever noticed the sky? It symbolises infinity. When the destination is infinity, how can stop in the middle thinking it to be an ultimate end? Life is all about moving and achieving. Stopping is like a rock which is fit for nothing but for mosses to grow around.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Corona has changed the way of living. It has confined the entire world on a single computer screen. Under this situation survival of many businesses has become so difficult. Updating yourself is the only way for survival. Companies which could not manage to cope up with change are on the verge of closure. That's the importance of moving, updating and learning. The moment you stop you are out of this race. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Talking about my personal experience, I have learnt this very hard way. Initial days of my college had a good graph of my achievement. I made into some of the most prestigious societies, I had an internship. In short, a bowl full of success made me quite complacent. From then my achievement stopped, Neither I tried learning new nor updating myself with some new skills. Very recently I grew quite active on LinkedIn. Seeing other people's achievements, made me introspect myself. It made me realise in this world where people are sitting which ocean of knowledge I was happy with just a bowl. I was actually behind many of my peers. Today once again I have started to move with a promise to never stop. In fact, now I have started. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Every phase in our life needs an updated version of ourselves. Therefore learning is of paramount importance. Ending my speech with a famous quote "If you can't run then walk If you can't walk then crawl but in any condition keep moving".</p>

                                    <h3>Life kits - work, rest and habits</h3>
                                    <h4>By Krishnkant Singh</h4>
                                </div>
                                <div class="blogpost-item-desc">
                                   <div id="article-2" class="text-area">
                                   <br>
                                    <p>Life is a play. And when we say play it requires energy. Our powers and energy find scope in work. Convenient work is very different from the work done in oppression. You all have heard to an adage” all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy” but all play and no work is even worse than the previous one. Worklessness is worse than doing boring work. If it has come up, then I would like to tell you a story referring from Tennyson’s poem in which he portrays an island where the people do not work and are constantly resting, they are referred to as “ lotus-eaters” .No work is permitted to solitary prisoners only, which makes life an unbearable ordeal for them. It is the worst thing to which one can be subjected.</p>
                                    <p>Rest is a very contradictory term. Its meaning varies from person to person as some associates it with a nap, or some it with sleeping 12 hrs at stretch. But according to an old English proverb “A change is as good as rest”. Which we can understand by taking a simple example: -suppose you are running for past 10 minutes what meant to be a rest for you is just stop and start walking …. Or just sit there ..you need not have a 12 hrs sleep. The rule of rest applies only after the work. let us imagine of 2 men having 24 hrs at stretch. One of them gone for ultimate rest doing nothing for the whole day and the other one woke up in morning perform his workouts  and after performing his ablutions he went on to read his academic books or normal books take a note of it. And after his lunch, takes a nap and then in the evening goes for a walk to explore nature or play some outdoor sports, and in night spend some time in books or some indoor games.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>Now you decide who will get the best out of his work and out of his rest? It is onto you to decide which kind of man you are……
The grotesque thing about energy is that it increases by spending. When we say energy, it can be mental or physical. You need to spend to increase it ..it is just like investing money… so you need to decide are you investing your energy or simply wasting?

                                    </p>
                                    <p>When you think of utilising your time effectively you must cultivate good habits. As the duke of wellington said that “habit was ten times nature”. Habits determine character and character determines destiny. So you have a master key to unlock the future you have decided for yourself… a chance to live up to your dreams.

                                    </p>
                                    <p>In every affluent culture, there are some moral values, ethics, tradition. Habits are a result of good or bad influences. Which is nothing but the practices that are entrusted from the former generation to the latter one? as these determine the quality of social life and of civilization itself.
Good habits do not come to you unsought. It requires a lot of time and care in inculcating good habits. But the trouble taken for the cultivation of good habits are worth having and are repaid by the good results given by good habits. Remember one golden rule by Sir Napoleon Hill i.e.” The man who does more than he is paid for will soon be paid for more than he does”.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>So you need to regularly work on good things and rest at its best, then it becomes a habit – a perfect life kit.</p>
